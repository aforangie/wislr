					High school students are social (awkward at times) and over 60% have smartphones.
					<br><br>
					To meet this opportunity, wislr is creating the world&#39;s first mobile network exclusively for high school students (even the awkward ones). We connect them to their two primary networks friends and classmates in a fun and unique way, with no risk of detention!
